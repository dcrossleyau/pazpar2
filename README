How to use this:

Usage: pazpar2 -f configfile -h [listen-host:]listen-port -p host-to-proxy -s targetfile

The host-to-proxy is the webserver where the user interface script
lives. It is used both for domain-name lookup and the contents of
the Host: header in rerquests that are proxied, so it's important
that the hostname is recognized by the webserver.

There are a few main target files:

test.pz: Single target, localhost:9999/Default -- use with
	yaz-ztest or a local Zebra test.

slow.pz: Single target, localhost:9999/Slow -- triggers a slow
	search response, useful for testing some stuff.

bibs.pz: A small set of serious catalogs in the US and Canada.

many.pz: Obscenely many catalogs.

Example:

Testing against ztest with Apache running on localhost port 80, pazpar
running on 8000. DocumentRoot in /var/www.

Fire up yaz-ztest
	yaz-ztest

Fire up pazpar2
	sudo cp -a www/* /var/www
	cd etc
	../src/pazpar2 -f pazpar2.cfg -h 8000 -p localhost:80 -s test.pz 

Fire up your browser:
	http://localhost:8000/test1/index.html

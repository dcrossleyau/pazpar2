Configuration may now have multiple server areas. This means that a
Pazpar2 instance may listen on multiple ports. Virtual hosting is not
yet supported - on a server basis. Configuration may also have multiple
services .. That is repeating service elements inside a server. Each
has an attribute 'id' which serves as service ID. This ID in turn may
be used in a Pazpar2 session, by specifying parameter service=ID for
command init. There can be at most one unnamed service inside a server
which can be referred to by not specifying an service ID for command
init (backwards compatible). In order to partition multiple servers and
services a new include directive has been added. This takes an attribute
'src' which specifies one or more sub-files. For example to include
service files, one might use:
  <server >.. <include src=/"etc/pazpar2/conf.d/*.xml"/> .. </server>.
It is the intention that that completely makes the settings directive
redundant.

Fix problem where the record command would wait forever if there were
no targets to wait for (activeclients == 0).

--- 1.1.1 2009/08/28

One result set is created per session (last search) rather than for
each connection which happen to be shared (bug #3009).

marc21 stylesheets changed for efficiency.

--- 1.1.0 2009/08/19

Session timeout may be specified on the command-line as option -T.

Pazpar2 may now be operated in a no-merged mode for records.. All records
will be considered unique. This mode is enabled if no mergekey is
generated by the normalization stylesheet (pz:xslt). 

Pazpar2 caches original records from each target and the 'record' command
with offset returns the original record if 'syntax' and 'esn' are NOT
specified. This speeds up retrieval of original records but also means
that Pazpar2 uses more memory. The cached records will be freed when the
session terminates or a new search is executed.

Pazpar2 no longer uses its own ICU wrapper. Instead the ICU wrapper
library part of YAZ is used.

Added SRU client support.

Automatically computes pz:nativesyntax if not provided. Works for XML and
MARC.

--- 1.0.13 2008/11/24

Command bytarget returns name of target (if defined).

--- 1.0.12 2008/11/04

Fixed bug #2021.. location now holds all brief elements.

--- 1.0.11 2008/10/15

Fixed check for application/x-www-form-urlencoded parameters.

--- 1.0.10 2008/10/14

Fixes for IE in pz2.js.

Fixed bug #2021: non-merged, brief meta data NOT included for command=show.

--- 1.0.9 2008/05/23

Changed the JS library pz2.js to use POST for long URL (+ params).

Added installation instructions for Windows. Note: NT services is
NOT available until we make a new release of YAZ.

Preserve order of repeated metadata fields (they were reversed before).

More MARC21 information extracted for metadata.

--- 1.0.8 2008/04/22

Fixed bug #1162: HTML entities are not escaped properly.

Native Windows port of Pazpar2. Makefile for Visual Studio provided.

--- 1.0.7 2008/04/14

Marc21 stylesheet updated to reflect multiple full text fields

--- 1.0.6 2008/03/12

Fixed bug in pz2.js WRT DOMElement attributes on IE.

Fixed bug 2100: Database wildcards not working

--- 1.0.5 2007/11/09

Added support for retrieval of records in binary.

Fixed bug 1794: Pazpar2 does not return valid XML.

Deal with ICU not returning sortkey (resulted in SEGV before).

--- 1.0.4 2007/09/28

JavaScript library pzw2.js throws error if WS response (from Pazpar2 or
other) is malformed (non-wellformed XML or missing Pazpar2 OK status).

Improved diagnostics when Pazpar2 HTTP decoding fails.

Pazpar2 requests may be POSTed as using Content-Type
application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

Pazpar2 honors LF in HTTP headers.

Handle targets that handle negative hit counts (should not happen, but it
does).

--- 1.0.3 2007/09/19

ICU is used for tokenization and normalization of the following: mergekey,
sorting, relevance terms.

Debian package now enables ICU tokenization and normalization by default.

--- 1.0.2 2007/08/22

Exposed user setting values (i.e. non-pz: names) to the record systems in two
ways: Either as parameters to the normalization stylesheets (which would allow the
programmer to postprocess or use the values in any way) or after the normalization
step, in which case values are made part of the normalized record (and available for
sorting, termlists, display, or other interface-related use.

Implemented sorting by year.

Option -d dumps records to the current log file instead of stderr.

Fixes for compilation on cygwin.

Z39.50 client code uses pz:elements. pz:elements was recognized in
earlier Pazpar2 versions but it was not used for anything.

icu_chain_test is using fgets instead of getline - fixes compilation
on MacOSX .

Loosen the CCL query parsing so that Pazpar2 only returns error if _all_
query conversions fail (rather than _any_). This means targets that do
not support some fields are ignored in a search.

--- 1.0.1 2007/07/03

Improved handling of socket timeout for Z39.50 connections. 

Misc documentation updates and spell fixes.

Debian package pazpar2 creates log rotate entry.

Debian package pazpar2-apache2 reloads Apache2.

jsdemo included in distribution. It illustrates the use of the js/pz2.js
JavaScript library.

--- 1.0.0 2007/06/20

First public release.

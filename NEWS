--- 1.2.4 IN PROGRESS

Support for additional fields in cf.xsl and pazpar2.conf.dist:
publisher, available, due, location (=locallocation), callno
(=callnumber), thumburl and score.

--- 1.2.3 2009/11/24

Metadata attribute 'skiparticle' also works for ICU based
normalization. (was only working for the non-ICU/ASCII before).

Command bytarget with argument settings=1 will show settings per
target.. This is to be able to verify correct settings and be able to
test that they are correct. The database settings array size is now
also stored..  Problems with database settings array is that if not
careful it will be too small (smaller than dictionary per-service
in settings).

Make record list sorting stable by comparing mergekey for records if
relevance/title or other sorting criteria all match. This is merely to
ensure that our regressions tests works (reproducible output).

Relevance calculation changes: use a different denominator (length) for
per-field relevance scoring.. Instead of length of all ranked fields we
now use length of individual fields (as if they were individual "free"
text fields). This will ensure that documents with a long field with no
match (say description) will not "hurt" a title match.

Diagnostic member was not set on connection error. Fixed

--- 1.2.2 2009/10/13

Command search takes two optional parameters, startecs and maxrecs,
that specifies the start offset (0, 1, ...) and maximum number of records
to fetch for each target.

XSLTs + MARC maps are cached within a session so we don't re-parse
them over and over again. Even for a session with a single search
there's much to be gained because many targets use the same
transformation.

The metadata attribute 'mergekey' now takes one of three values 'no',
'required', 'optional' .  And the resulting mergekey from metadata
is now ordered in the same way as metadata in the service definition.
Older Pazpar2 version use the order in which metadata appeared in a
record instance.

The search argument 'filter' now offers a new operator ~ which does a 
substring match. The = operator works as before: string match for
anything but pz:id, or target match for pz:id.

New setting pz:recordfilter. The value of this setting takes the
form name[~value]. This setting makes Pazpar2 ignore all retrieved
records that do not have the metadata element name with value substring
(if given).

Pazpar2 allows YAZ log level to be set (option -v).

--- 1.2.1 2009/10/05

For WS responses Pazpar2 creates XML header. Exception: raw record.

Setting XML files are now stored in etc/settings instead of etc. This
reflects the layout with the Debian package layout.

Settings may be posted for command=settings. The POSTed settings must
have root element 'settings' like regular setting files. In order to be
recognized, the POST request must use Content-Type=text/xml.

A service may be posted for command=init. This service will be used
during the session. The service may have its own target settings,
ICU config, timeout, etc. In order to be recognized, the POST request
must use Content-Type=text/xml.

Timeout values may be given per-service. That's element 'timeout' 
which takes three attribute values (a subset may be given): 'session',
'z3950_operation', 'z3950_session'. Option -T is no longer supported
- used to specify session timeout.

Option -t tests the Pazpar2 configuration and returns exit code
(0=success, non-zero=failure). In previous version of Pazpar2, -t
specified local settings.

In version 1.2.0 the configuration file - after include processing -
was dumped to stdout. Now, the configuration is only dumped to the
yaz log file if option -d is given.

--- 1.2.0 2009/09/10

Configuration may now have multiple server areas. This means that a
Pazpar2 instance may listen on multiple ports. Virtual hosting is not
yet supported - on a server basis. Configuration may also have multiple
services .. That is repeating service elements inside a server. Each
has an attribute 'id' which serves as service ID. This ID in turn may
be used in a Pazpar2 session, by specifying parameter service=ID for
command init. There can be at most one unnamed service inside a server
which can be referred to by not specifying an service ID for command
init (backwards compatible). In order to partition multiple servers and
services a new include directive has been added. This takes an attribute
'src' which specifies one or more sub-files. For example to include
service files, one might use:
  <server >.. <include src=/"etc/pazpar2/conf.d/*.xml"/> .. </server>.
It is the intention that that completely makes the settings directive
redundant.

Fix problem where the record command would wait forever if there were
no targets to wait for (activeclients == 0).

--- 1.1.1 2009/08/28

One result set is created per session (last search) rather than for
each connection which happen to be shared (bug #3009).

marc21 stylesheets changed for efficiency.

--- 1.1.0 2009/08/19

Session timeout may be specified on the command-line as option -T.

Pazpar2 may now be operated in a no-merged mode for records.. All records
will be considered unique. This mode is enabled if no mergekey is
generated by the normalization stylesheet (pz:xslt). 

Pazpar2 caches original records from each target and the 'record' command
with offset returns the original record if 'syntax' and 'esn' are NOT
specified. This speeds up retrieval of original records but also means
that Pazpar2 uses more memory. The cached records will be freed when the
session terminates or a new search is executed.

Pazpar2 no longer uses its own ICU wrapper. Instead the ICU wrapper
library part of YAZ is used.

Added SRU client support.

Automatically computes pz:nativesyntax if not provided. Works for XML and
MARC.

--- 1.0.13 2008/11/24

Command bytarget returns name of target (if defined).

--- 1.0.12 2008/11/04

Fixed bug #2021.. location now holds all brief elements.

--- 1.0.11 2008/10/15

Fixed check for application/x-www-form-urlencoded parameters.

--- 1.0.10 2008/10/14

Fixes for IE in pz2.js.

Fixed bug #2021: non-merged, brief meta data NOT included for command=show.

--- 1.0.9 2008/05/23

Changed the JS library pz2.js to use POST for long URL (+ params).

Added installation instructions for Windows. Note: NT services is
NOT available until we make a new release of YAZ.

Preserve order of repeated metadata fields (they were reversed before).

More MARC21 information extracted for metadata.

--- 1.0.8 2008/04/22

Fixed bug #1162: HTML entities are not escaped properly.

Native Windows port of Pazpar2. Makefile for Visual Studio provided.

--- 1.0.7 2008/04/14

Marc21 stylesheet updated to reflect multiple full text fields

--- 1.0.6 2008/03/12

Fixed bug in pz2.js WRT DOMElement attributes on IE.

Fixed bug 2100: Database wildcards not working

--- 1.0.5 2007/11/09

Added support for retrieval of records in binary.

Fixed bug 1794: Pazpar2 does not return valid XML.

Deal with ICU not returning sortkey (resulted in SEGV before).

--- 1.0.4 2007/09/28

JavaScript library pzw2.js throws error if WS response (from Pazpar2 or
other) is malformed (non-wellformed XML or missing Pazpar2 OK status).

Improved diagnostics when Pazpar2 HTTP decoding fails.

Pazpar2 requests may be POSTed as using Content-Type
application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

Pazpar2 honors LF in HTTP headers.

Handle targets that handle negative hit counts (should not happen, but it
does).

--- 1.0.3 2007/09/19

ICU is used for tokenization and normalization of the following: mergekey,
sorting, relevance terms.

Debian package now enables ICU tokenization and normalization by default.

--- 1.0.2 2007/08/22

Exposed user setting values (i.e. non-pz: names) to the record systems in two
ways: Either as parameters to the normalization stylesheets (which would allow the
programmer to postprocess or use the values in any way) or after the normalization
step, in which case values are made part of the normalized record (and available for
sorting, termlists, display, or other interface-related use.

Implemented sorting by year.

Option -d dumps records to the current log file instead of stderr.

Fixes for compilation on cygwin.

Z39.50 client code uses pz:elements. pz:elements was recognized in
earlier Pazpar2 versions but it was not used for anything.

icu_chain_test is using fgets instead of getline - fixes compilation
on MacOSX .

Loosen the CCL query parsing so that Pazpar2 only returns error if _all_
query conversions fail (rather than _any_). This means targets that do
not support some fields are ignored in a search.

--- 1.0.1 2007/07/03

Improved handling of socket timeout for Z39.50 connections. 

Misc documentation updates and spell fixes.

Debian package pazpar2 creates log rotate entry.

Debian package pazpar2-apache2 reloads Apache2.

jsdemo included in distribution. It illustrates the use of the js/pz2.js
JavaScript library.

--- 1.0.0 2007/06/20

First public release.

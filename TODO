Short term: 

Structured target profiles -- Zeerex.
Normalization of records -- test if libXSLT is fast enough to:
  -- Extract Subject headings, titles, dates, authors for facets and display
  -- Merge keys for relevance ranking, etc.
  -- Also normalize to UTF-8.
Implement timeout of sessions, so they don't sit there forever (simple).
Sort by title, date, author. Parameter to 'show' webservice command.
Additional facets. At least do 'author'.. think about making it general.
Support for 'blocking' requests, at least for record display before first records
   are retrieved (to reduce polling).
Implement detection of 'search complete', so client knows when to stop polling.
Full record retrieval.
Implement hitsbytarget function to emulate traditional LOT-style U/I

Longer term:

Server-specific CCL-mapping (simple)
Networked mechanism to control configuration
Target selection by metadata -- 'subject', 'location', 'library
	type' -- should be totally generic to support requirements of
	different projects.

Nice to have:

Short term: 

Pull more metadata from records. Figure out how this relates to record retrieval
Structured target profiles -- Zeerex?  -- requires libxml
Sort by title, date, author. Parameter to 'show' webservice command.
Full record retrieval. -- libxml

Longer term:

Server-specific CCL-mapping (simple, follows from structured target profiles)
Networked mechanism to control configuration
Target selection by metadata -- 'subject', 'location', 'library
	type' -- should be totally generic to support requirements of
	different projects.
Factor Z39.50 stuff out from pazpar2.c to separate file to make room for
   later SRU implementation (essential if we do THDI or LOT. Not hard to do)

Nice to have:

Short term: 

Structured target profiles -- Zeerex?  -- requires libxml
Normalization of records -- test if libXSLT is fast enough to:
  -- Extract Subject headings, titles, dates, authors for facets and display
  -- Merge keys for relevance ranking, etc.
  -- Also normalize to UTF-8.
Sort by title, date, author. Parameter to 'show' webservice command.
Additional facets. At least do 'author'.. think about making it general. -- libxml
Implement detection of 'search complete', so client knows when to stop polling.
Full record retrieval. -- libxml
Implement hitsbytarget function to emulate traditional LOT-style U/I
  -- Begs a 'limit by target' type of function...  ??

Longer term:

Server-specific CCL-mapping (simple, follows from structured target profiles)
Networked mechanism to control configuration
Target selection by metadata -- 'subject', 'location', 'library
	type' -- should be totally generic to support requirements of
	different projects.
Factor Z39.50 stuff out from pazpar2.c to separate file to make room for
   later SRU implementation (essential if we do THDI or LOT. Not hard to do)

Nice to have:

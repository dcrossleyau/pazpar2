Heikki's experiments with ranking

Personal notes, likely to be out of date.

Things to experiment with, and find out, and mess about

Goals:
 - Understand the ranking
 - make a better ranking merging algorithm




Tue 19-Nov-2013 Started this branch


Wed 20-Nov-2013 Make a script that tests ranking against yaz-zserver
(as that is the default config). Mostly to have a script to build on later.

Thu 21-Nov-2013. Start my own complete config

<!-- NOTE: This is not yet a functional config file. It's meant as a scratchpad/
     discussion area to figure out just how the heck to structure this kind of
     configuration.
-->

<!-- thought... right now there is only one global 'service' in the code, but
     it will be pretty simple to make this repeatable, and I think that should
     be done at some point (this will eliminate most of the global parameters.
     But it might be nice to have 'virtual' targets, so differrent sets of
     configuration could live within one listener (on a single
     port). -->

<service>
    <listen port="9004"/>
    <proxy host="localhost" port="80"/>

    <termlist name="subject"/>
    <termlist name="author"/>

    <metadata name="title"/>
</service>

<!-- Need to figure out where to get ZeeRex records for targets from -->

<!-- The 'profiles' below are repeatable, and tagged with an ID, so that they
     can be linked with targets. -->

<!-- Oooh!!! They can be generated dynamically using XSLT. I just peed in my pants. -->

<queryprofile/>  <!-- Like a CCL profile? Or do these need to be 
			dynamically generated from Zeerex??  -->

<retrievalprofile/>   <!-- Specify what stylesheets to use to normalize records?? -->
